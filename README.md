    git clone https://github.com/jatail/nord-jatail $ZSH/themes/nord-jatail

and then in your `.zshrc` include the line `ZSH_THEME="nord-jatail/nord"`.

This theme is a modified version of [this](https://github.com/fxbrit/nord-extended) which is modified version of [this](https://github.com/TyWR/Nord-zsh) one, many thanks to both.
